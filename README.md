# PRODIGY_DS_05 - US Accidents Analysis and Visualization

# Task Description

In this task, I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing road accidents across the United States. The goal was to analyze accident severity, time distribution, and environmental conditions that may contribute to accidents.

# Technologies Used

Python
Pandas
Seaborn
Matplotlib
Folium

# Key Steps
Loaded and inspected the dataset
Checked for and handled missing values
Converted timestamps to datetime and extracted the accident hour
Visualized:
Distribution of accident severity
Frequency of accidents by hour of day
Top 10 weather conditions during accidents
Created an interactive Folium map showing accident locations using a random sample
